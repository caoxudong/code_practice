https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in `nums` to be `k`​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

    int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
    int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

    int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

    assert k == expectedNums.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
    }

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.


Example 1:
* Input: nums = [1,1,2]
* Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
* Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
* Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
* Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
* Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
