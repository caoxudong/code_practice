You are given the head of a sorted linked list.

Delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
* Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
* Output: [1,2,5]

Example 2:
* Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
* Output: [2,3]

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
