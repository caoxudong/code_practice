There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly left rotated at an unknown index `k` (1 <= `k` < `nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k]`, `nums[k+1]`, ..., `nums[n-1]`, `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, ..., `nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be left rotated by 3 indices and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.



Example 1:
* Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
* Output: 4

Example 2:
* Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
* Output: -1

Example 3:
* Input: nums = [1], target = 0
* Output: -1

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
* -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
* All values of nums are unique.
* nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
* -104 <= target <= 104
