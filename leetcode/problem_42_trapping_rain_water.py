Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
* Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
* Output: 6
* Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
* Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
* Output: 9

Constraints:
* n == height.length
* 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
* 0 <= height[i] <= 105
